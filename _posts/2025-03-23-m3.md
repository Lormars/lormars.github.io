# Bugs
Still mining on graphql bugs. Graphql subscription is actually very interersting. Since it uses websocket, many applications would implement it differently from "normal" graphql query and mutation requests, leaving it subject to various access control bugs. 

# Readings & Research

4. [google leak creator emails](https://brutecat.com/articles/youtube-creator-emails): The report reveals vulnerabilities in Google's API endpoints, where incorrect parameter types and ProtoJson requests can leak detailed debug information and expose sensitive data, such as content owner IDs and associated emails. But it also showcased how difficult it is, even for a company like Google, to secure something that is not industry standard, whether it is a protocol or a particular functionality.
