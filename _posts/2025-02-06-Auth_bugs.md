When I began learning web application hacking about a year ago, authentication vulnerabilities were among the first I encountered, from weak passwords to bypass two-factor authentication. However, when I started testing web applications in-depth three months ago, I avoided digging into authentication issues. Why? I assumed they were already overhunted, with countless hackers uncovering duplicates or finding only the hardest-to-spot flaws.

After two months of hacking, I decided to shift gears and explore authentication bugs more seriously. The reason is that I discovered:

1. There are far more authentication-related reports you can learn from than I expected, and many go beyond what's typically covered in textbooks (I mean portswigger academy).
2. Write-ups revealed that even well-tested platforms could harbour authentication bugs that weren’t impossible to identify.
3. I wanted to challenge myself and broaden my approach.

So, I dedicated three weeks solely to finding and exploiting authentication vulnerabilities. Here’s a breakdown of what I uncovered and the lessons I learned.

## Data

Bugs Found: 25 (Valid: 11; Informative: 12; Duplicate: 2)

## Let's Talk About "Failure" First

Surprisingly, most of my "invalid" bug reports weren’t closed due to duplicates. This was unexpected—perhaps because valid authentication bugs tend to be fixed quickly. Instead, the most common reason for rejection was "accepted risk" or "intended behavior." Essentially, the programs were aware of these "issues" but chose to leave them in place due to various considerations.

### Some Examples of Accepted Risk

1. **SAML SSO Admin Takeover** – If a program uses SAML SSO, the admin of a team can often take over a team member’s account by setting up the IDP and creating accounts without verifying emails. This is generally considered an accepted risk.
2. **Auth System Migration** – When a program is in the process of phasing out its authentication system, non-critical vulnerabilities may be deprioritized or marked as accepted risks.
3. **2FA Bypass via Social Login** – In some cases, 2FA is required for login with a username and password but not when using social login (e.g., Google authentication).

While these types of issues are often classified as "accepted risks," that doesn’t mean they aren’t worth reporting. The decision to fix them depends on the program’s policies and threat model, so it’s always worth submitting them.

## The Most Frequent Bug Type

The most common authentication-related vulnerability I’ve found is **2FA bypass**. However, it’s rarely about brute forcing or other direct bypass techniques (only two cases). Instead, the most frequent 2FA bypass I’ve encountered involves **bypassing 2FA on sensitive actions** rather than just during login.

Modern applications don’t just enforce 2FA at login; they also require it for certain high-risk actions, such as changing emails, passwords, or other account details.

Some examples:

- In one program, users were required to complete 2FA before changing their email. However, I discovered that the email change took effect **after entering the password but before passing 2FA**, allowing an attacker to exploit this flaw. So always check whether you can complete the flow with only your password. Don't rush to enter your OTP code.
- Another program required 2FA for email changes, but while it was properly enforced on the web app, the **desktop application** allowed users to bypass it entirely.
- In one case, an API response included an attribute `"verified": false`, indicating that a user hadn’t passed 2FA. Changing it to `"verified": true"` in a proxy typically wouldn’t work, but I found that **one specific endpoint lacked server-side enforcement**, allowing me to bypass 2FA entirely.

The takeaway: **Be thorough. Even if 99 out of 100 endpoints properly enforce 2FA, you can’t assume the last one does.**

## The Most Fruitful Hacking Method

The most effective hacking method I’ve found isn’t just brute force testing or blindly manipulating requests—it’s actually **reading the documentation**. Instead of jumping straight into Burp Suite and messing with requests, taking the time to understand how the system is designed can reveal unexpected weaknesses.

For 2FA vulnerabilities, reading documentation is particularly valuable for:

- Understanding what security measures should be in place (and checking if they are actually enforced).
- Identifying inconsistencies between different platforms (e.g., web vs. mobile vs. API).
- Spotting overlooked attack vectors, such as alternative authentication flows or deprecated endpoints.

For example, in one very well tested program that offers huge amount of bounties even for medium, I uncovered a very straightforward 2fa bypass by just reading the documentation. The program specifically said, literally in the first few pages on their documentation, that 2fa would be required in their desktop application when users want to publish their blog. So I just installed the desktop application, enabled 2fa, and tried to publish. Boom! No 2fa was checked! I immediately reported this, and this bug is VALID! No duplicate! 5 minutes reading the docs earned me `$$$$`. That is the power of reading the documentation. Don't assume that well tested large program would not have such straightforward bugs. The most critical bugs are often not the most complex. Sometimes you only need to read.

Ultimately, **hacking isn’t just about breaking things—it’s about understanding how they work.** The more you understand the intended behavior, the better you can spot when something isn’t working as expected.

## Be Thorough
One particularly interesting bug involved an ID verification bypass. While not strictly an authentication issue, the process of uncovering it was fascinating.

In a private program, I initially discovered a vulnerability that only worked after a user had verified their ID. When I reported it, the program dismissed it as merely informative, arguing that ID verification was a prerequisite for using the system, thus limiting the impact of my attack. However, they mentioned they would reconsider if I could find a way to bypass the ID verification itself.

This response left me puzzled. At no point had I encountered any ID verification requirement while using the program. According to their reply, I should not have been able to access the system at all without verifying my ID—yet I had done so effortlessly. That’s when it hit me: I must have unknowingly bypassed their ID verification!

Realizing I had stumbled upon a separate vulnerability without even noticing, I immediately began testing. After some investigation, I discovered that their ID verification system was based on IP addresses. For some unknown reason, using an IP (or VPN) from a different country allowed me to bypass the verification entirely.

This experience reinforced an important lesson: sometimes, the most critical vulnerabilities are the ones you don’t even realize you’ve exploited. Always question unexpected access or behavior, as it may reveal deeper security flaws. Thorough testing and curiosity can lead to significant discoveries.

## Money missed
If you take away just one lesson from this blog, let it be this: never rush to report a vulnerability before fully exploring its impact.

In one program, I discovered an undocumented legacy API endpoint that was still in use by some versions of the application. Excited by my finding, I immediately reported its most obvious consequence—a 2FA bypass.

However, in the days that followed, I continued testing and uncovered even more severe issues linked to this same endpoint, including access control bypass and API key leakage. I submitted these findings as separate reports, believing they were significant vulnerabilities in their own right.

Weeks later, I received a response from HackerOne. They closed my later reports, citing that all of them stemmed from the same root cause and leaving only my initial report open. The problem? My first report was rated as **High** severity, while the vulnerabilities I found later were **Critical**. I immediately requested a severity reassessment so that the remaining open report would reflect the most severe impact.

Unfortunately, my request was ignored, and the program only rewarded me based on the initial **High** severity rating. The case is now in mediation, but even if it succeeds, the process has been time-consuming and frustrating—something that could have been entirely avoided if I had taken the time to fully investigate the vulnerability before submitting my report.

**Moral of the story:** Always dig deeper before reporting. A vulnerability’s most obvious impact may not be its most severe, and failing to uncover its full scope early on could cost you both time and a higher reward.

That's about it. See you next month!
