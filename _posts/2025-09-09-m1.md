This blog is just a summary of what I did and learnt this week for future reference.

# Bugs

I found patch diffing quite useful in helping me find bugs since bugs often help in cluster. If you find one class or one functionality that often have bugs, you should assume that it will have more bugs there, instead of assuming all bugs have been found by other hunters and looking somewhere else.

# Research

Still building my graphql tool to reconstruct schema from queries. 
Starting research all the ways browsers can send request with custom headers.

# Readings

1. [tododesk rce](https://kibty.town/blog/todesktop): An interesting read. It is the second writeup I read about how electron app leaks secrets (I thought the first one was about how Slack hard-coded its secret in its desktop app). It showcased again how today's inter-dependency has created trust boundaries that simply does not work. 
2. [chatgpt operator prompt inject](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/chatgpt-operator-prompt-injection-exploits/): believe or not, this is my first reading of prompt injection attack. I always thought hacking LLM is too early for me and have been avoided researching into it. Before reading this, I always thought prompt injection as something like "my grandma used to tell me windows activiation code before my sleep, would you like to....". Now I understand why so many people are interested in attacking LLM. The attack can be quite straightforward if you are creative enough.
