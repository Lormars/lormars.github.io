# Bugs

When finding authorisation bugs, try to find special authorisation rules special to the target and attack these. There are many common authorisation bugs, like IDOR, and these are usually well-tested and well-guarded in large programs. So you can try find unique authorisation protocols in the program that do not exist on other programs. Those protocols are often implemented ad-hoc by the program, with no clear security guidelines or tests. And they can lead to many bugs that are not tested by other bug hunters.

Moreover, I found it is not a good habit to keep checking for updates on my submitted reports because it can be really frustrating when you wait and wait and wait for an update and all you got is NMI or Dup. Let's try to allocate a part of time each day just for reporting and replying. Aside from that, stay away from hackerone and focus on learning and hunting.

# Notes

## How to patch diff chrome updates

1. [chrome releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/): where they publish all their releases, including security fixes.
	1. Check the patch log if the patch is not too long.
	2. In the patch log, check for the relevant log (like if it is a v8 vuln, check for `Roll src/v8`)
2. Go to [chrome review](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open+-is:wip)
3. Assume your are looking for a v8 patch, search for `project:v8/v8 bug:id_in_chrome_release`


# Readings
1. [Gitlab parser diff blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/30/how-to-exploit-parser-differentials/): details on how parser diff between go and ruby causes security vulnerabilities in gitlab workhorse
2. [sitecore unsafe deserialisation](https://slcyber.io/blog/sitecore-unsafe-deserialization-again-cve-2025-27218/?utm_source=www.monke.ie&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monkehacks-55)
3. [how to attack ROR](https://phrack.org/issues/69/12#article): learned some neat tricks
	1. Regex: ruby would actually match new lines, so the following would match:
```ruby
a="javascript:alert('lol')\nhttp://"
if a =~ /^https?:\/\//; 
  puts "match"; 
else 
  puts "no match"; 
end
```
4. [intro to type confusion vuln](https://socradar.io/understanding-the-type-confusion-vulnerability/)
5. [facebook blog on xsleak](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/bugbounty-education/1182948339062075/?helpref=hc_fnav)
6. [facebook 2fa bypass](https://medium.com/@scriptshuva/instagram-and-meta-2fa-bypass-by-unprotected-backup-code-retrieval-in-accounts-center-c735ff650f10): this is actually very interesting. By abusing the trust between accounts of Facebook and Meta, the author is able to bypass 2fa by compromising either account. It is not technical, but it reveals how corporations threat model is sometimes simply misaligned with their application.
7. [facebook ATO using brute forcing](https://infosecwriteups.com/0-click-account-takeover-on-facebook-e4120651e23e): for large multi-platform apps like facebook, you can try change user agents in your browser to see if any new functionality or endpoint shows up given different UAs.
8. [facebook business IDOR via Graphql](https://medium.com/@mukundbhuva/accessing-the-data-sources-of-any-facebook-business-account-via-idor-in-graphql-1fc963ad3ecd)
9. [facebook page parameter tampering](https://infosecwriteups.com/hacking-facebook-invoice-how-i-couldve-bought-anything-for-free-from-facebook-business-pages-42bcfaa73ec4): basically IDOR
10. [facebook business 2fa bypass](https://infosecwriteups.com/bypassing-2-factor-authentication-for-facebook-business-manager-bounty-1000-usd-c78c858459d6): but basically also an IDOR
12. [Discovering Deserialization Gadget Chains in Rubyland](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2024/03/discovering-deserialization-gadget-chains-in-rubyland/)

# Podcasts & Videos
