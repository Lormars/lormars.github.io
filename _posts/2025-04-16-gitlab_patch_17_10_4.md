In this blog, I will pick some authorization-related security patches and try to reverse engineer how it is caused. This blog would focus on Gitlab 17.10.4

## IP restriction Bypass Through Graphql Subscription
Commit: 7019ae8aa04f49f66d7db86ec4023f816f8e90f1

This patch is relative simple.
```diff

+          end
+        end
+      end
+    end
+  end
+end
```

Based on the patch, it added a callback for `ActionCable` to check `request.ip`. ActionCable is used by Gitlab to create and remain websocket channel for Graphql subscription. So it can be known that before the patch, Graphql subscription is not IP restricted, and an user can bypass IP restriction to leak updated info using Graphql subscription.

## Global search count leak for confidential issues
Commit: 46932e9f78e0b138b8fd7320b2e4e4c09f2fcfc0

Based on the release description, this attack allows attackers to perform targeted searches with sensitive keywords to get the count of issues containing the searched term. Let's see the patch:
```diff
diff --git a/ee/lib/search/elastic/filters.rb b/ee/lib/search/elastic/filters.rb
index bdb4c77d9219..8e8f488bda46 100644

             next query_hash if user&.can_read_all_resources?
 
             scoped_project_ids = scoped_project_ids(user, project_ids)
             authorized_project_ids = authorized_project_ids(user, scoped_project_ids)
 
-            # we can shortcut the filter if the user is authorized to see
-            # all the projects for which this query is scoped on
-            if !(scoped_project_ids == :any || scoped_project_ids.empty?) &&
-                (authorized_project_ids.to_set == scoped_project_ids.to_set)
-              next query_hash
-            end
```

The patch is relatively simple. Gitlab simply deletes the shortcut when the user is authorized to see ALL the projects the current query is scoped on. From this we can reverse engineer. Since a Guest is also authorized to see all the projects if they are a member, a Guest would also follow this short circuit. But a Guest cannot see confidential issue, which would lead to this vulnerability.

## Unintentionally authorizing sensitive actions on users behalf
Commit: b154f7884178a622da6d60fdcbd1097ce50cc6cb

Based on the release note, under certain conditions, an attacker could potentially trick users into unintentionally authorizing sensitive actions on their behalf. Let's see the patch:
```diff
diff --git a/app/views/doorkeeper/authorizations/new.html.haml b/app/views/doorkeeper/authorizations/new.html.haml
index 38cb6d40cc4d..bea64ee9b1a6 100644

+
+#container.gl-ml-auto.gl-mr-auto.gl-pointer-events-none{ class: 'sm:gl-w-1/2' }
```

Ok this is actually very interesting. All the patch does is to "add delay when pointer events are enabled for 0Auth authorize page", and it instantly remind me of this [double clickjacking](https://www.paulosyibelo.com/2024/12/doubleclickjacking-what.html). Though I have not reproduced it, I have a strong feeling that this attack is taking use of double clickjacking to make victims authorize unintended actions. 

That's it. See you next time!
