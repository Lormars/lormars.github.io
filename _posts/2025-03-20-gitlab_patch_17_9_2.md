In this blog, I will pick some authorization-related security patches and try to reverse engineer how it is caused. This blog would focus on Gitlab 17.9.2

## Disclaimer

I am by no means an expert in ruby/bug bounty hunting/ruby on rails/source code review. As I explore hacking, I use writing and sharing blogs as a way to reinforce my understanding. The content below reflects my best effort to grasp the vulnerability, but it may not be entirely accurate.

# Prevent custom role to activate group members
Commit: efbd1afae3cce6bb4e03e91ed82b7af27671977f

Based on the patch description, this patch fixes `Guest with custom Admin group member permissions can approve the users invitation despite user caps`. Let's take a look at the patch:

```

From the patch, we can see that before the patch, there is no separate ability `activate_group_member`, and the privilege to activate a group member conflates with `admin_group_member`, which lead to this vuln since any role with the custom admin member group permission would grant `admin_group_member` to that role, making them able to add users despite user caps.

Now there is a separate `activate_group_member` ability, and even if a user is a member of `admin_group_member`, he cannot activate group members unless he is the owner.

# Prevent Internal Notes Leaking to Non-members
Commit: a55e5b359912daa90ef07c73ebd66b4bb9b0e2c3

Based on the patch description, this patch fixes the bug that `Internal Notes in Merge Requests Are Emailed to Non-Members Upon Review Submission`. Let's dive into the patch:
```diff

       @discussions = Discussion.build_discussions(@review.discussion_ids, preload_note_diff_file: true)
       @include_diff_discussion_stylesheet = @discussions.values.any? do |discussion|
```

For reference and better understanding, let's also check the email template of `new_review_email`:
```haml
- @notes.each do |note|
  -# Get preloaded note discussion
  - discussion = @discussions[note.discussion_id] if note.part_of_discussion?
  -# Preload project for discussions first note
  - discussion.first_note.project = @project if discussion&.first_note
  - target_url = project_merge_request_url(@project, @merge_request, anchor: "note_#{note.id}")
  = render 'note_email', note: note, diff_limit: 3, target_url: target_url, note_style: "border-bottom:4px solid #ededed; padding-bottom: 1em;", include_stylesheet_link: false, discussion: discussion, author: @author

```

From the patch and the template, we can see Gitlab mainly added a check on the `recipient` to make sure they can read internal notes before sending the the email. If the recipent can read internal notes, then nothing would be changed, and the template would render all notes including internal notes. If not, Gitlab will first filter out internal notes, and then the template would proceed to render only those notes that the recipient has read access to.

# Prevent disclosing credentials when repository mirroring fails
Commit: af6f445b66c3353652c47ad36b1c700c2c0572a1

Based on the release, this patch fixes the vulnerability that lead to `Credentials disclosed when repository mirroring fails`. Let's dive into the most relevant part of the patch:

+      content.gsub(unencoded_basic_auth_regex, masked_basic_auth)

```

We can see through the patch that Gitlab added a `sanitize_unencoded` class method. If there is a username or password, this method would replace username and password with `MASK`, which is just `****`. 

# Prevent shell code injection in Google integrations
Commit: 7fd30226d79520b742abd9edc01055766f56c39b

According to the release, this patch fixes `Maintainer can inject shell code in Google integrations`. The patch is relatively simple:
```diff
diff --git a/ee/app/models/integrations/google_cloud_platform/workload_identity_federation.rb b/ee/app/models/integrations/google_cloud_platform/workload_identity_federation.rb

         validates :workload_identity_federation_project_number, presence: true, numericality: { only_integer: true }
```

From the patch, we can see it mainly added validations for various fields needed to set up google integrations. Reverse trace the field `workload_identity_federation_project_id`, we can find it is used in `google_cloud_integration_runner_project_setup.sh.erb`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -eu
set -o pipefail

if [[ "${1:-}" == "--debug" ]]; then
  set -x
  shift
fi

GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="<%= google_cloud_project_id %>"
GRIT_PROVISIONER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="grit-provisioner"
GRIT_PROVISIONER_ROLE_ID="GRITProvisioner"

```

Note here the `google_cloud_project_id` actually refers to `workload_identity_federation_project_id`. Since this is a bash script, without the validation added in this patch, a malicious user can inject code into this bash script using `workload_identity_federation_project_id`.

That's it. See you next time!
