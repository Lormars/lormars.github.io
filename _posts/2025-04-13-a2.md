# Notes
Browsers are increasingly blocking third-party cookies by default due to privacy concerns:

Firefox blocks third-party cookies from known trackers by default. Its Standard mode uses Total Cookie Protection, isolating cookies per site. Strict mode blocks all third-party cookies.

Safari (Apple) uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to block third-party cookies by default.

Chrome (Google) only blocks third-party cookies by default in Incognito mode, but users can enable blocking in regular mode. Google is gradually disabling them for some users and working on alternatives through its Privacy Sandbox project.

Overall, browser vendors are shifting away from third-party cookies while still supporting essential web functionality.
